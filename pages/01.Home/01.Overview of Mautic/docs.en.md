#### Contact Management

Build a rich and functional database of Contacts for your business, group them together based on your business needs or based on shared attributes.

- [Contacts][contacts]: Individuals who have visited your websites or interacted with your business in some way. They may be known or unknown visitors. Contacts are the primary factor of a marketing automation platform.
- [Segments][segments]: A group of your Contacts that share certain attributes. For example, you may segment Contacts based on a contact’s location. This may help you easily send out location-based offers or promotions to this specific group of Contacts.
- [Companies][companies]: A group of Contacts based on the Company(ies) that the Contact is assigned to. 

 **Components**

Create and manage various types of content that you will use for your marketing campaigns to engage your contacts.

- [Assets][assets]: Valubable items that you provide to your contacts upon completion of a form. Whitepapers, a downloadable application/file, documents or vidoes are some examples of assets.
- [Forms][forms]: Forms are the primary point of customer contact. They're used to collect user information, often in exchange for providing access to an asset such as a download, an event registration, or an email newsletter.
