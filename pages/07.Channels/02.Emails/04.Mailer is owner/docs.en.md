## Sending emails from lead owner

This functionality allows Mautic to automatically personalize emails sent to a user who has an owner (mautic user) assigned to them. This feature changes *from email*, *from name* and *signature* by changing the default setting to the Mautic lead owner's user setting.

### Requirements

- Mautic 1.3.0+
- A non-tokenized mail transport. **This feature won't work with emails sent via API** (Mandrill, Sparkpost and Mailjet).

### How to enable the emails sent from contact owner

- Open the admin menu by clicking the cog icon in the top right corner.
- Select the *Configuration* menu item.
- Select the *Email Settings* tab.
- Switch the *Mailer is owner* to *Yes*.
- Save the configuration.

## Signature

Signature is also a new feature in the Mautic 1.3.0. There are two places where to configure the signature text:

1. The **default signature** is in the *Configuration*, *Email Settings* tab. 
	
	The default text is `Best regards,<br/>|FROM_NAME|`. 
	
    The `|FROM_NAME|` token will be replaced by *Name to send mail as* value also defined in the *Email Settings* tab. 

	This signature will be used **if the contact owner is not known**.

1. Every user can configure their own signature in the profile edit page. This signature will be used **if the contact owner is known**.

	The signature can be placed into an email text using the `{signature}` token.

	There is one exception where the contact owner's signature won't be used. 

	When a user sends an email **directly from a contact** , the currently logged in user's signature will be used and **not the lead owner**. 
    
    It doesn't matter if the contact has another owner assigned or if it doesn't have an owner at all.

## FAQ

### Does it work for all emails?

There are exceptions:
* The email has to be sent to a contact. 
	If Mautic doesn't have a contact assigned with the email, it doesn't know its owner and therefore cannot know what user name, email and signature to choose. 
    
    This also happens when you send test emails.
    
* If you send an email directly from the contact detail, the *from name* and *from email* will be used from the form where you create the email to send, and not from the user settings of the lead owner. 

	The values used are pre-filled with those of the currently logged in user.
