Point Leagues is a feature that allows users to categorize the score of their contacts. By setting up point leagues, users can assign a specific number of points to each action taken by a contact, such as opening an email, visiting a landing page, or downloading a resource.

## Managing point leagues
To access the currently defined point leagues in Mautic, navigate to the Points Menu and click on the "Manage Leagues" link. To create a new league, simply click the "New" button.
