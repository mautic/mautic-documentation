Themes control the look and feel of the Mautic landing pages, emails, forms and message screens.  A basic Mautic installation will come pre-packaged with a number of themes which can be used 'as-is' or adapted to suit specific projects.  It is also possible to [create a theme][mautic-theme] for Mautic from scratch.
