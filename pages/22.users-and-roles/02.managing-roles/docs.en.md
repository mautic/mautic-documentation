Roles are used in Mautic to control what resources and actions a user can access.

## Creating a new role

To create a new role, navigate to Roles using an Administrator account via the Settings cog at the top right of the screen and selecting 'Roles'.  Then click on 'New'.

### Full System Access

If you enable the 'Full System Access' switch, you are creating an Administrator account which has the highest level of access to your Mautic instance.

These accounts should be limited, and you should ensure that they have secure credentials.

If you select this option, you will not be able to configure anything under 'Permissions' because by default, this account has full access to everything.

### Setting granular permissions

Mautic allows you to create roles with granular permissions for each bundle - or part - of Mautic.  

To configure a role, leave the Full System Access switch at 'No' and click on the Permissions tab to start building the role.

#### Explaining the permission options

There are several different permission options that can be selected:

There are permission levels relating to being able to manage resources:

There are permission levels relating to what fields in the Users section can be edited:

* Specified fields - allow or deny the users with this role to edit specified fields in the Users section (e.g. Name, Username, Email, Position)
* All - this allows the users with this role to edit all fields relating to the Users section
