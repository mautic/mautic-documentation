## Campaign Overview

The campaign overview will show you many details of your campaign including the number of contacts which have been added to a campaign, the number of emails sent, and the number of page views resulting from the campaign.

Additional information includes a quick overview of what decisions and actions are available on a campaign, as well as a grid layout overview of all the contacts on a campaign.

As with many of the other overview screens you can view the recent activity taken place on the campaign.

## Basic Campaign Creation
Creating campaigns is an easy process which involves picking a name, creating a description, and defining the segments to associate with the campaign. These campaigns can then be assigned a category and defined publishing information. All of these are rather standard aspects of a new campaign creation.

**Note**: The segment selection will only show public segments. This means any segments created by individuals within the company marked as private will not be available for campaigns.

## Advanced Campaign Creation

The basics of campaign creation are handled easily by the initial screen but the finer details of building a campaign occur within the campaign builder. This might be considered advanced campaign creation but every campaign does need to use the campaign builder.


## Executing Campaign Actions

Executing starting actions for contacts newly added to the campaign, scheduled actions and the actions on the "non-action" decision paths, must be triggered by the system. To do so, create a [cron job][cron-jobs] that executes the following command at the desired interval:

```
php /path/to/mautic/bin/console mautic:campaigns:trigger --env=prod
```

If you want to execute the command at different intervals for specific campaigns, you can pass the `--campaign-id=ID` argument to the command.

## Building Campaign Contacts

Batch adding/removing contacts for campaigns is done by using the following command:

```
php /path/to/mautic/bin/console mautic:campaigns:update --env=prod
```

See documentation on [cron jobs][cron-jobs] for further detail.
