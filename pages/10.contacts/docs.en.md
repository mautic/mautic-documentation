Leads were renamed to contacts in [Mautic 1.4.0][mautic-140].

Contacts are the central factor of a marketing automation platform. These are all the individuals who have visited your websites or interacted with you in some way.

## Contact Types

There are two types of contacts:
* **Visitors** (formerly anonymous leads) — visitors to your site who have not yet been identified by a form or other interaction.
  * These contacts are tracked by Mautic but typically remain hidden so as not to clutter your segment.
* **Standard contacts** — contacts which have identified themselves via a form or some other source. As a result, these contacts typically have a name, email, and other identifying fields.

### Visitors (formerly anonymous leads)

Anonymous leads were renamed to visitors in [Mautic 1.4.0][mautic-140].

You can view visitors by using the 'table view' (use the "t" keyboard shortcut to view contacts in a table or "c" as cards) within the contacts section.

Visitors are worth tracking, because these could be future customers. By tracking them before they have any interaction, you can retain a log of when they visited your site, which allows you to get a picture of their activity prior to engaging with you.

#### Search Text
You can use the filter in the Contacts screen to display only visitors by using the following command in the search bar above the contacts list:

```
is:anonymous
```

The resulting list will display those IP addresses which have not yet provided identifying information.

### Standard Contacts

The second type of contact is a standard - or known - contact. These contacts have identified themselves via a form or other source. You may also have more information about them from previous interactions, or from a third-party system such as a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool. As a result, these contacts typically have a name, email, and other identifying information which can be associated with the contact.

The standard contact is the preferred contact within Mautic. These are contacts which may have started as a visitor, but at some point provided additional information such as a name, email address, social network handle, or other identifying characteristics which have enabled you to connect up the activity on your website with a known person. You can nurture these contacts through the Mautic marketing automation platform, learn more about their behaviour, and take specific actions as a result of this information.

The [Manage Contacts][manage-contacts] section provides more information on how you can work with contacts in Mautic.
