## Understanding the Mautic User Documentation Repository Structure
Mautic documentation is written using [Markdown markup][markup]. The Markdown files are appended with the *.md* extension.

When you fork the Mautic user documentation repository, the repository includes the following files and folders:

- **`README.md`** file introduces and describes the repository, but does not contain any product documentation.
- **`pages`** folder contains folders for each chapter in the Mautic user guide. Each chapter folder contains its own **`docs.en.md`** (one per language - currently, English only) file and the different images used in the *.md* files. For example, within the **Campaigns** folder, you'll find sub-folders for sub-topics such as **Managing Campaigns**, **Campaign Events**, etc..
- **`plugins`** folder contains folders for each plugin that Mautic offers.
- **`themes`** folder contains a folder with supporting files for different themes that Mautic offers.

## Reading the Style Guide

We encourage you to read the [Mautic Style Guide][style guide] for submitting content with a consistent tone, voice, and messaging across the Mautic user documentation. You can find the Mautic Style Guide [here][style guide].

## Finding an Issue

You can familiarize yourself with the Mautic contribution process by reviewing the list of **`good first issues`**, earmarked for new contributors on the [Issues][doc-issues] section. These issues have a relatively limited scope. 

â€‹â€‹After you have selected an issue on the [Mautic Documentation Issues][doc-issues] page, follow the below steps:
 1. Add a comment indicating that you would like to own the ticket. This is to avoid conflicts with others also working on the issue.
 1. After a Mautic administrator assigns you the issue, you can modify files and track changes on GitHub using command line utility, your web browser, GitHub Desktop, or Gitpod.
<br>For more information on how to contribute using GitHub, refer to the [Contributing Changes](#contributing-changes) section. 
 1. Submit a pull request, and share it with a Mautic administrator to review your changes.

## Reporting an Issue
For reporting an issue or proposing a change, follow these steps:
1. Create a new GitHub issue associated with the relevant repository and propose your change there. Be sure to include implementation details and the rationale for the proposed change.
2. The submitted issue will automatically have the ðŸš¦ status: awaiting triage label applied. Wait for a Mautic administrator to evaluate your issue.
1. If the Mautic administator approves the issue and removes the ðŸš¦ status: awaiting triage label, you may start working on the task as described above in the "Contributing to an Issue" section.

## Contributing Changes

This section explains how you can create pull request to submit changes and collaborate using Git, web browser, GitHub Desktop, or Gitpod.

### Using Git on the Command Line

Using Git, you can clone the Mautic user documentation repository on your machine, and edit the documents locally. Changes are proposed in a branch, which ensures that the default branch only contains finished and approved work. The changes can then be commited for tracking, and submitted as a PR link with Mautic reviewers. 

Git requires a GitHub user account, a terminal running bash, and a computer with Git installed and configured. If you want to work with Git locally, without using the command line, you can work with the [GitHub Desktop](#using-github-desktop) client.
Alternatively, you can also install GitHub CLI to use GitHub from the command line. For more information, visit [About GitHub CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli) page.

To edit documents using Git:

1. Launch the command-line tool on your machine.
1. Change the working directory in the terminal to the location where the documentation repository will reside using the ```cd ``` command.
1. Clone the Mautic user documentation repository.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mautic/mautic-documentation.git --origin upstream
   ```
1. Create a new branch to manage your edits, and name it descriptivly. For example, ```{yourusername}-revision-readme-file```

    ```
    git checkout -b {yourusername}-revision-readme-file upstream/master
    ```
1. After editing the documents, commit your edits to your local repository, and add a commit message. The Git commit command requires a commit message that describes what has changed and why so that collaborators to track, review, and merge the edits.

   ```
      git status --short
      git add <new and modified files>
      git commit --message 'move contributing to new file
    ```

1. Push the current branch to GitHub to synchronize the changes, and set the remote as upstream.

   ```
   git push --set-upstream origin {username}-revision-readme-file
   ```
   You will be prompted to enter your GitHub login credentials.

1. After youâ€™ve pushed your commits, visit your repository on GitHub to view the reflected changes and the commit history.Review the changes at your fork ```-https://github.com/{yourusername}/mautic-documentation.```

1. Submit a pull request for a review of the commited changes. For more information, visit the [Creating a Pull Request](#creating-a-pull-request) section.
