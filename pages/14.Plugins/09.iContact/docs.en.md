## Authorize

In order to connect your [iContact][iContact] account with [Mautic][mautic], you'll have to create an [iContact APP][iContact-app].

Follow the [tutorial][iContact-app] to create your [iContact APP][iContact-app].

When you have your [APP][iContact-app] created, you should be able to see this screen:

## Configure the plugin

1. Fill in the new credentials for [Mautic][mautic] - [iContact][iContact] integration:

   - APP ID = the Application ID you created
   - APP username = the email you use to log into your [iContact][iContact] account. (Not the APP name)
   - APP password = The password chosen when saving the [APP][iContact-app].

1. Navigate to the *Features* tab in the plugin configuration modal box.

   1. Select the _iContact_ Segment where the Mautic Contacts should be pushed into.

      There should be one Segment created by default.
