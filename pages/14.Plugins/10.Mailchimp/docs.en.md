## MailChimp integration

[Mautic][mautic] can send Contacts to [MailChimp][mailchimp] based on [Contact actions][testing] or [Point Triggers][points].

## Version notes

- For [Mautic 1.2.3][release-1.2.3] and [later][release-latest], the authentication is based on the API key.

  This is covered in this document.

- For [Mautic 1.2.2][release-1.2.2] and older
  - a MailChimp app has to be created
  - the authentication is made via oAuth2
  - Client key and secret credentials are needed for authentication
  - SSL (https) connection is required

This plugin is backward compatible.

- If the client ID is filled, the plugin will use oAuth2.
- If the client ID is empty, the plugin will let you insert the API key.

> **Note**
>
> In this document, there may be references to outdated terminology such as
>
> - _leads_,
> - _lists_ or _lead lists_, and
> - _anonymous leads_
>
> In [Mautic version 1.4][release-1.4.0],
>
> - _leads_ were renamed to _**contacts**_
> - _lead lists_ were renamed to _**segments**_
> - _anonymous leads_ were renamed to _**visitors**_
