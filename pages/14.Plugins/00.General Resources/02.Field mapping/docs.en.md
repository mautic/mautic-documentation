## Field Mapping in a plugin integration

At the *Contact Field Mapping* tab is the list of available fields from an integration.

You have to select the Mautic Contact Field equivalent so each field will get the right value.

> **Note**
>
> You don't have to map every field. Map only those you want to push into the integration.
